Automator Workflows
-------------------

These are some useful services than can be used within all OS X applications to avoid dropping into the shell or going to websites to perform some simple actions like, base64encode. Just copy the `Services/*` files to `~/Library/Services`. Use them in whatever application you want by clicking the name of the application next to the Apple menu button, then click Services and pick the service you want.

* Base 64 Decode
* Base 64 Encode
* New UUID4
* Random SHA1
* Random SHA512
